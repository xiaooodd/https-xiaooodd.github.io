<p><strong>Assignment 1 (04/07/2020)</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>1. What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you solve them?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest challenge for me was using git. Because before that I have no contact with this program. So I watched the textbook and zoom videos provided on canvas over and over again. Finally I understand how to create and upload in git.</p>
<p><strong>2. What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</strong></p>
<p>I learned the basic techniques for using git. And the basic techniques for html.</p>
<p><strong>3. What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</strong></p>
<p>I think the textbooks on Google and canvas are the most helpful to me.</p>
